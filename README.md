# pis2

Inherited favorable theoretical properties of particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, the second-order Particle Iterated Smoothing can improve the parameter estimations in term of i) shortening the burn-in period, (ii) accelerating the mixing of the Markov chain at the stationary period, and (iii) simplifying tuning.

It is inherited from R package pomp and is2, so it can virtually be applied to every model therein. 

At the moment, support is provided for 
- particle iterated filtering
- particle iterated smoothing
- 2nd order particle iterated smoothing
- average particle iterated smoothing

Simple worked examples are provided in the test directory of the installed package.

Future support for a variety of other algorithms is envisioned.
